## Biography

I am Jubayer, recent alumni with Bachelor and Master’s in Microbiology. I aspire to maximize the quality of life of the human around me by working at the intersection of education, technology, and health research.


Recently, I have completed my internship at the Health System and Population Studies Division, [icddr,b](https://www.icddrb.org/). I did my Bachelor and Masters from the Department of Microbiology at [Jagannath University,Dhaka](https://jnu.ac.bd/dept/portal/web/microbiology). 

I am also the founder of [Center for Health Innovation, Research, Action and Learning - Bangladesh (CHIRAL Bangladesh)](https://chiralbd.netlify.app/), a non-profit organization dedicated to health research to improve lives in Bangladesh.

At CHIRAL Bangladesh, I lead four programs: [Health Research ToolBox - A Step by Step Guide for Beginners](https://hrt.chiralbd.org/), [The Undergraduate Research Training Program (URTP)](https://urtp.chiralbd.org/), [Scientific Computing for Biologists](https://chiralbd.netlify.app/teaching/programs/), and the other one is [Health Data Analytics](https://chiralbd.netlify.app/teaching/programs/). In addition, I make [content](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbkJ5pm65Fkcs7MK4YshLsQ) on Data Analysis with Python and R.

Python is my primary language for data analysis and machine learning. I also have a basic understanding of R, Julia, SPSS, QGIS, and SQL.

This page highlights my teaching and research projects. Please [reach out](https://allmylinks.com/jhossain28) if you want to collaborate or have questions.
