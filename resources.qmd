It provides researchers with access to a vast collection of publicly available gene expression datasets derived from cancer studies. ONCOMINE allows users to explore gene expression patterns, identify potential biomarkers, and compare gene expression between different cancer types or subtypes.



## Guideline for Bioconductor Users
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) is an open-source and open-development software project that provides a comprehensive collection of bioinformatics and computational biology tools in the R programming language. It focuses on the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data, including DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, microarray analysis, proteomics, and more.


## Required software
- R: <http://www.r-project.org/> (FREE)
- RStudio (additional libraries required): <http://www.rstudio.com/> (FREE)

## Prework

Before attending the any workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.
-   Recent version of **R**
-   Recent version of **RStudio**
-   Most recent release of the [**Bioconductor**](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/) and other packages used in courses

Install the latest release of R, then get the latest version of Bioconductor by starting R and entering the commands. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.16")
```

- Ensure you can knit R markdown documents

    -   Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document
    -   Save the document and check you are able to knit it.

## Install Bioconductor Packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
```

Install specific packages, e.g., “GenomicFeatures” and “AnnotationDbi”, with


```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicFeatures", "AnnotationDbi"))
```

The `install()` function (in the BiocManager package) has arguments that change its default behavior; type ?install for further help.
